### Hey there!

Want to use an extension to add events to Google Calendar without having to switch tabs?

Check out Secretary!

To use it, clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/GabrielGuirguis/Secretary-HTML-CSS-JS-.git`

Go to Chrome -> Extensions -> Enable Developer Mode -> Load Unpacked

Then select the cloned directory and voil√†!

The extension will prompt you to sign in once you load it or once you try to add your first event.
